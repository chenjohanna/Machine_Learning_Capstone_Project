This capstone project was completed in the MIT Applied Data Science Program. It uses machine learning, specifically regression, for prediction. 

The key objective of this project is to build a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and ultimately help used-car businesses in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.

The file 'Johanna_Chen_Capstone_Project_Regression.ipynb' contains my work; the programming language I used was python. The libraries I used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn, and statsmodels. The file 'used_cars.csv' is the dataset I work with in this project.

The following data exploration and regression models highlight features and models that play a crucial role in accurately predicting the price of used cars. I tested four models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Ridge Regression. This project proposes the Random Forest model for effectively predicting the price of used cars. The final model accounts for 85% of the variance in the target variable 'Price' on the test dataset. Multiple features of a car impact the price of it; the most significant ones are power, year, and engine. Some next steps may be using the model as an aid to price a used car, but sellers need to take into consideration policies in different locations and changes in the new and used car market.
